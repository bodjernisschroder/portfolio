                        answer:'Our goal is to provide high-quality forex EAs at an affordable price for traders of all levels. While some EAs in the market may have higher price tags, we believe that cost should not be a barrier to accessing powerful trading tools. We have optimized our strategies and streamlined our operations to offer competitive pricing without compromising on performance. By keeping our prices accessible, we aim to empower a wider community of traders to benefit from our reliable and effective EAs, ultimately helping them achieve their trading goals.'

                        answer:'No, never. Many other programs offer a ton of upsells for this and that, creating a paywall that will leave most members feel left out in the cold. At MMFX, we will never have any upsells. The monthly fee is the only cost to get complete access to everything, and it will stay that way.'

                        answer: 'Monitoring and avoiding heavy news events in forex trading is crucial due to the unpredictability and increased volatility these events can cause. They can lead to rapid price movements, fluctuating liquidity, and widened spreads, which can disrupt trading strategies, particularly those used by automated systems like EAs. By avoiding these periods, traders can better manage risk and protect their capital. We highly recommend checking our automated news calendar every week to watch out for heavy news events. You can find it in the main menu of the members area.'

                        answer:'Make sure you don\'t test more than 1000 combinations in one go. If you tick a lot of settings at the same time, it could go into the hundreds of thousands or even millions of combinations that need testing, which will take a long time. You can check in the bottom right corner of the screen near the start button how many combinations your currently picked settings would run. Try to keep it fairly low! Also, backtesting speed is tied to your computers processing power. If your own personal computer is very slow, then we recommend backtesting through the VPS.'

M1 = every minute, M5 = every 5 minutes, and so on.'

                        answer:'Don\'t test more than 1000 combinations at once. If you select many settings simultaneously, the number of combinations that need testing could be very high, slowing down the process. Try to keep the number of combinations low. Backtesting speed is also tied to your computer\'s processing power. If your computer is slow, consider backtesting through the VPS.'

                        question: 'My bot isn\'t taking any trades',
                        answer:'Check the bot settings on the chart after you\'ve attached it. Go into the \'Common\' tab and make sure \'Allow Algo Trading\' is checked. If there\'s a \'Dependencies\' tab, make sure \'Allow DLL imports\' is checked. Inside the MT5 terminal click on Tools -> Options, and then go into \'Expert Advisors\' and check the same boxes as indicated in the guide. Make sure \'Algo Trading\' is enabled in the toolbar of MT5. If your bot has expired, download a fresh bot file from the members area and install it. Note that the bot doesn\'t always find a trade entry every day. Check your scheduling settings to see when the bot will look for trades. If the bot isn\'t trading despite these checks, try re-attaching the bot to the chart and loading your settings again, or restart your MT5 terminal. If that still doesn\'t work, try rebooting your VPS.'

                        answer:'Follow the steps in "How do I open the bot settings on the chart?" and then go into the \'Common\' tab once the settings window pops up. Once here, uncheck \'Allow Algo Trading\' to prevent the bot from trading entirely. If you still want it to trade, but only want to skip a certain day, go into the \'Inputs\' tab and scroll down to the \'Scheduling Settings\'. Here you simply set the specific day during the week you don\'t wish to trade to \'False\', which will make the bot skip that day entirely. If you want to skip a day further into the future, you can add the date in the \'Days To Avoid Trading\' field, using the following format: DD.MM.YYYY and separated with commas, no spaces.'

                    {
                        question: 'How do I make the bot stop trading when it has reached my goal?',
                        answer:'Open the bot settings window as explained in "How do I open the bot settings on the chart?" and then go into the inputs tab. At the top, you\'ll see a setting called \'Overall Profit Goal\'. Input your goal plus a small buffer to account for broker commission and/or slippage. Once that overall profit has been hit, the entire bot will be removed from the chart to prevent any further trading. The overall profit goal is disabled if you set it to 0.'

                    {
                        question: 'I\'ve hit the max allowed loss today, what happened?',
                        answer:'This can happen due to market volatility and unpredictability. It\'s important to average out every month in great profit, despite the occasional bad day. Bookmark https://www.myfxbook.com/forex-economic-calendar and check it once a week. It shows all the news and publications scheduled to hit every day, and what their impact might be on the Forex market. If you see a day with heavy news for your trading pair, you can go into your bot settings and set that day to False to avoid it entirely.'
