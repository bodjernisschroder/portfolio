        <p>
            Once you have paid your invoice, you are not eligible for a refund unless your ability to travel is affected by something covered under airline or EU passenger rights.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you cancel for any reason — personal or otherwise — you are not entitled to a full or partial refund from Gotorz, unless the airline cancels the flight entirely.
        </p>

        <p>
            Gotorz is not responsible for reimbursing airline tickets. However, you may be entitled to a refund directly from the airline if the flight was canceled by them or if you were denied boarding.
        </p>

        <h5 class="fw-bold mt-4">✈️ What Are Your Rights if You’re Denied Boarding or the Flight is Delayed?</h5>
        <p>
            If you are flying from an EU airport or with an EU-based airline, you are protected by EC Regulation 261/2004.
        </p>

        <h5 class="fw-bold mt-4">⏱ Delay Cases</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>If your flight is delayed more than 2 hours, you’re entitled to care (refreshments, communication access, and accommodation if overnight).</li>
            <li>If your delay exceeds 5 hours and you choose not to fly, you are entitled to a refund.</li>
            <li>If your delay causes you to miss the final leg of your journey, you can request compensation depending on total delay time and impact.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5 class="fw-bold mt-4">❌ Cancellation or Denied Boarding</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If your flight is canceled less than 14 days before departure, the airline must provide:
                <ul>
                    <li>An alternative flight to your destination</li>
                    <li>Or, full refund for the ticket</li>
                    <li>Plus: financial compensation between €250 and €600 depending on flight distance</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If your new arrival time is delayed more than 2–4 hours, compensation may still apply (reduced 50% in some cases).</li>
            <li>You can also request care services during the wait (meals, hotel if needed, transport, etc.).</li>
        </ul>

        <h5 class="fw-bold mt-4">🛡 How to Claim Compensation</h5>
        <p>
            You must file a claim directly with the airline (or through their official site). If the airline rejects the claim or delays the process,
            we can assist by referring you to trusted legal support services that handle EU travel claims.
        </p>

        <p>
            These services typically work on a no-win-no-fee basis. If successful, they’ll get your refund + compensation — at no extra cost to you.
