        <ul>
            <li>Your booking is confirmed and fully paid. You don’t need to print a voucher or show a hotel confirmation unless explicitly required.</li>
            <li>Make sure to check the check-in and check-out times of your accommodation. If arrival and collection are not aligned, contact the host in advance.</li>
            <li>If you're staying in a private home or apartment, reach out to the host to confirm your check-in time and how to get the keys.</li>
            <li>If your accommodation isn’t suitable, contact Gotorz right away — we can assist you in relocating at no extra cost.</li>
            <li>Some countries charge a tourism tax, which you may be asked to pay in cash at the location — this is not included in your package.</li>
            <li>We’ll send your boarding pass and check-in documents about 12 to 24 hours before your flight. You don’t need to print it; your phone is fine.</li>
            <li>If you haven’t received your boarding pass in time, reach out to us immediately. It might be delayed if you booked late or changed flight details.</li>
            <li>If you can’t access your flight ticket for any reason, contact the airline — in many cases, they’ll help for free, but some charge an extra fee.</li>
            <li>Be at the airport on time. If you're late and miss check-in, you may have to pay for a new ticket or may not be allowed to board at all.</li>
            <li>In case of issues at the airport or delays, contact us. We’ll help with support, documentation, and communication with the airline.</li>
            <li>If your boarding pass wasn’t issued for reasons related to the airline, you may be eligible for a refund — contact us for assistance.</li>
            <li>Luggage rules: Most flights allow one suitcase (40–55 cm) and a small carry-on. Some airlines don’t allow cabin luggage — always double-check!</li>
            <li>Infants: There may be additional rules for baby gear (strollers, carriers, etc.). Contact us for specific instructions if traveling with kids.</li>
            <li>Airport security rules vary by country. Don’t carry liquids over 100 ml, and always comply with customs and safety regulations.</li>
            <li>Do not carry any prohibited items (flammables, chemicals, sharp tools, etc.). Failure to comply may result in fines or being denied boarding.</li>
            <li>Keep all your valuables in your carry-on bag and don’t check in passports, cash, or electronics.</li>
        </ul>
