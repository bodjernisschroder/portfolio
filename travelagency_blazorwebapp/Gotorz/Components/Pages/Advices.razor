            Based on our experience, here are some helpful tips to ensure your trip is safe, smooth, and free from avoidable issues:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Arrive at the airport at least 2 hours early — don’t risk last-minute surprises.</li>
            <li>Listen for airport announcements, and keep your boarding pass and passport handy.</li>
            <li>If there are any issues at passport control, stay calm and work with the officer to resolve it — even if you’re denied entry.</li>
            <li>Keep your passport, visa, and travel documents in your hotel safe — not in your luggage or purse when out exploring.</li>
            <li>Avoid arguing in public spaces — this can escalate and create legal issues.</li>
            <li>Don’t assume someone understands your language — be polite, speak slowly, and ask for help if needed.</li>
            <li>If you're using electronic devices at check-in or security, make sure they're charged and ready to present.</li>
            <li>Always inspect your hotel room when you arrive. Don’t accept the key until you're satisfied.</li>
            <li>If you’re driving abroad, bring a translated version of your license or international driving permit.</li>
            <li>If you're traveling within the EU, get a free SIM card or roaming package to avoid expensive data charges.</li>
            <li>Don’t carry all your cash in one place. Split it between bags or use a money belt or travel wallet.</li>
            <li>Use zippered luggage and lockable compartments to avoid theft — especially on trains or at stations.</li>
            <li>Put heavier items at the bottom of your suitcase to balance it and avoid tipping.</li>
            <li>If you buy new clothes abroad, be mindful of import restrictions or customs limits.</li>
            <li>Buy local currency only from official exchange spots (never from strangers or unlicensed kiosks).</li>
        </ul>
